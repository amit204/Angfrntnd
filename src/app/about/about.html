                        <p>Before we talk about us, let’s talk about you.</p>
                        
                        <p>You love to eat. That’s right, we’ve got your number. There’s no need to be 
                            shy about it — we love to eat, too.  </p>
                        
                        <p>We’ve been helping you eat for awhile now, and we wouldn’t have it any other way.
                            We also know about all the other stuff you love: Like cooking and getting together,
                             and talking about eating, and sharing it all here, on Greenrecipes.com.</p>
                         
                        <p>Over the fifteen-year life span of Greenrecipes.com, we’ve learned that – in addition to 
                            eating – sharing is what you do best. And thanks to the 20 million of you who come
                             here each month, we now have 500,000 recipes to show for it, more than anywhere 
                             else in the digital universe. We also have tons crazy-tempting photos, 
                             troves of recipe reviews and more than 2 million Facebook likes. 
                             That’s a heck of a lot of Food. Thank you!<p>

                            and see where it all takes you. We’re glad you’re here, and we invite you to come back often.
