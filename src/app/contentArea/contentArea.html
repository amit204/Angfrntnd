                                 Greenrecipes.com was created in 1999 outside of Seattle, 
                                 Washington. What started as an idea to connect 
                                 home cooks from all over the world has grown into a daily cooking community, 
                                 featuring 500,000+ user-generated recipes, 125,000+ photos and millions of reviews. </p>
